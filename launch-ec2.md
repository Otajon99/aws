## Task 1: Launch Your Amazon EC2 Instance
In this task, you will launch an Amazon EC2 instance with termination protection and stop protection. Termination protection prevents you from accidentally terminating the EC2 instance and stop protection prevents you from accidentally stopping the EC2 instance. You will also specify a User Data script when you launch the instance that will deploy a simple web server.


4. In the **AWS Management Console** choose  >**Services**, choose **Compute** and then choose **EC2**.

**Note:** Verify that your EC2 console is currently managing resources in the **N. Virginia** (us-east-1) region.  You can verify this by looking at the drop down menu at the top of the screen, to the left of your username. If it does not already indicate N. Virginia, choose the N. Virginia region from the region menu before proceeding to the next step.

5. Choose the > **Launch instance**  menu and select **Launch instance.**
